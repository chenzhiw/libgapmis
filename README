libgapmis is an ultrafast library for pairwise short-read alignment, based on
GapMis, including accelerated SSE-based and GPU-based versions. For more
information visit http://sco.h-its.org/exelixis/gapmis/.

For installation instructions check the file INSTALL.

To use the library on general-purpose CPUs, include gapmis.h and link using
-lgapmis. You may link with -lgapmis -static to statically link the library
to your binary. In case of a dynamic linkage, specify the library path in
$LD_RUN_PATH or $LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

To use the library on CPUs with SSE instruction set, include gapmis.h and link 
using -lgapmis_cpu -lgapmis_sse. To use the library on GPUs, include gapmis.h 
and link using -lgapmis_cpu -lgapmis_gpu. The same notes for static and dynamic
linkage apply for both optimised versions.
