INSTALLATION
------------

Libgapmis comes in three flavours, the original unoptimised version, and two
optimised versions -- SSE and GPU.

To install the original unoptimised version run the following commands after
extracting the package.

  ./configure
  make
  make install

The library file will be installed in ${PREFIX}/lib. You may change ${PREFIX}
using standard autotools switches such as:

  ./configure --prefix=PREFIX

The header files will be installed in ${PREFIX}/include/libgapmis, and some 
example files in ${PREFIX}/share/examples/libgapmis. The manual pages will 
also be installed. You may view it using:
  
  man 3 libgapmis

You may chose to compile (and eventually install) an optimised version of the
library by specifying it in the --enable-opt switch. For example, to install
the SSE optimised version, run

  ./configure --enable-opt=sse
  make
  make install

To install the GPU optimised version

  ./configure --enable-opt=gpu
  make
  make install
